# Understanding Cache System.

So, the cache is how our client stores data about items and many other things.
I will make this documentation better later; for now, I will just focus on the item name cache.

---

When our client goes to get an item name, it does it through the cache, even if you patch the client to not use the cache, all it basically do is, that it doesnt **create** the cache folder for us, but inside the client, it will still use the cache system, just never **save** it
